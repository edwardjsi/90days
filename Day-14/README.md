# Day 14 – Ansible Zero to Hero (Ad-Hoc Commands & Inventory)

## Goal

Understand and practice the difference between Ansible Ad-Hoc commands and Playbooks, and learn how inventory grouping enables targeted automation.

## What I did

* Created an Ansible inventory file with logical host groupings for web and database servers.
* Practiced Ad-Hoc commands using the `ping` module to validate connectivity.
* Documented reusable Ad-Hoc commands in a shell script for quick operational checks.

## What this proves

* I understand when to use Ad-Hoc commands versus Playbooks.
* I know how Ansible inventory grouping works and why it matters.
* I can verify connectivity safely before running configuration changes.

## How this helps a client/employer

* I can quickly validate server reachability during incidents.
* I can target automation precisely without affecting unrelated systems.
* I can reduce operational risk by testing connectivity before deployment.
