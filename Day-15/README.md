# Day 15 – Ansible Playbooks (Install & Start Nginx)

## Goal

Learn the structure of an Ansible Playbook and use it to install and manage a service in a repeatable and automated way.

## What I did

* Created a basic Ansible playbook starting with YAML document syntax (`---`).
* Defined hosts, tasks, and enabled fact gathering to collect system information.
* Installed and started the Nginx service using an ordered set of tasks.

## What this proves

* I understand the core structure and execution flow of an Ansible Playbook.
* I know why `gather_facts` is required before task execution.
* I can debug playbook execution using verbose mode (`-vvv`).

## How this helps a client/employer

* I can automate service installation consistently across servers.
* I can troubleshoot configuration issues with detailed execution logs.
* I can replace manual server setup with repeatable infrastructure automation.
