## What is Git?
Git is a distributed Version Control System (VCS) used to track changes in code.
It allows developers to:
- Save versions of work
- Roll back mistakes
- Collaborate safely
- Maintain a full history of updates

Git runs locally on your system.

## What is GitHub?
GitHub is a platform that hosts Git repositories online.
It provides:
- Collaboration via Pull Requests
- Code reviews
- Project visibility
- Backup & history

Git = tool  
GitHub = platform
