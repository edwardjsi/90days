# Day 16 – Infrastructure as Code (IaC) Strategy

## Goal

Understand **why Infrastructure as Code is a business decision** and document the rationale for choosing Terraform over cloud-native tools to avoid vendor lock-in.

---

## What I did

* Studied the historical reliance on cloud-specific IaC tools (e.g., AWS CloudFormation) and the vendor lock-in problem they create.
* Understood the core IaC objective: **portability, repeatability, and long-term flexibility**, not just automation.
* Learned Terraform’s **API as Code** approach and how it uses a universal language (HCL) to work across multiple cloud providers.
* Documented the business and technical reasons for choosing Terraform for multi-cloud and hybrid-cloud strategies.

---

## What this proves

* I understand that **IaC decisions impact long-term business flexibility**, not just day-to-day operations.
* I can explain **vendor lock-in as a strategic risk**, not merely a technical limitation.
* I understand how Terraform abstracts cloud provider APIs into a **single, consistent workflow**.
* I can justify tooling choices based on **architecture and business outcomes**, not tool popularity.

## How this helps a client/employer

* Reduces long-term cloud dependency and improves negotiation leverage with vendors.
* Enables future **multi-cloud or hybrid-cloud adoption** without rewriting infrastructure code.
* Improves team productivity by keeping skills **portable and reusable**.
* Aligns infrastructure strategy with business continuity, scalability, and risk management goals.
