# Git Branching Strategy – Documentation Task

## Goal
Document a clean and practical Git branching strategy that makes the repository easier to maintain and scale.

## What I did
- Defined standard branch types (`main`, `feature/*`, `hotfix/*`, `docs/*`).
- Added naming conventions for better readability and traceability.
- Documented a simple workflow for creating, merging, and fixing branches.
- Standardized commit message format for consistency.

## What this proves
- I understand Git beyond basic `add`, `commit`, and `push`.
- I can design workflows instead of just following them.
- I think about long-term maintainability, not just today's task.

## How this helps a client/employer
- I can bring structure to messy repositories.
- I can implement disciplined version control practices.
- I help teams avoid chaos with branches and releases.
- I understand how professional teams collaborate in Git.
